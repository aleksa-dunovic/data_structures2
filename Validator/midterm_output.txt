upholsterers' warehouses for security; the hi$hwayman in the dark was a City tradesman in the li$ht, 
and, bein$ reco$nised and challen$ed by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of "the Captain," 
$allantly shot him throu$h the head and rode away; the mail was waylaid by seven robbers, 
and the $uard shot three dead, and then $ot shot dead himself by the other four, "in consequence of 
the failure of his ammunition: "after which the mail was robbed in peace; that ma$nificent potentate, 
the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand and deliver on Turnham $reen, by one hi$hwayman, who despoiled
