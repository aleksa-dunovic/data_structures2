Case 1: formatting cIntro.txt:

C is an imperative 
procedural language. It was 
designed to be compiled 
using a relatively straightforward 
compiler. It provides low-level 
access to memory. It 
provides language constructs that 
map efficiently to machine 
instructions. It requires minimal 
run-time support.
----
Case 2: formatting chistory.txt:

C is a general-purpose, 
imperative computer programming language, s
upporting structured programming, lexical 
variable scope and recursion,while 
a static type system 
prevents many unintended operations. B
y design, C provides 
constructs that map efficiently 
to typical machine instructions, 
and therefore it has 
found lasting use in 
applicationsthat had formerly been 
coded in assembly language, i
ncluding operating systems, as 
well as various application 
softwarefor computers ranging from 
supercomputers to embedded systems. C
 was originally developed 
by Dennis Ritchie between 
1969 and 1973 at 
Bell Labs, and used 
to re-implement the Unix 
operating system.It has since 
become one of the 
most widely used programming 
languages of all time, w
ith C compilers from 
various vendors available for 
the majority of existingcomputer 
architectures and operating systems. C
 has been standardized 
by the American National 
Standards Institute (ANSI)since 1989 
(see ANSI C) and 
subsequently by the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO).
